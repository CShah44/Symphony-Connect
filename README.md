## Tech Stack

_Framework:_ NextJS with TypeScript

_UI_: ShadCN UI with TailwindCSS, Framer Motion

_Database_: MongoDB

_Forms_: React-Hook-Forms with Zod Validation

#### Other Tools Used:

_ML API_: HuggingFace's Inference API

_Realtime Capabilities_: PusherJS

_File Storage_: Uploadthing

_Authentication_: Clerk

### Why this stack?

This stack was chosen for its ability to deliver a highly performant, scalable, and maintainable application. Next.js with TypeScript ensures that the core of the application is robust and easy to work with. It leverages the use of server components making it more powerful to work with. Clerk simplifies authentication along with webhook capabilities, making it secure and straightforward. MongoDB allows for a dynamic and flexible schema that be easily expanded. Pusher introduces real-time capabilities, essential for a dynamic user experience. Finally, shadcn and Tailwind CSS allow for rapid UI development with a clean and modern design.

## Challenges faced

Here are some of the challenges I faced:

#### 1. Onboarding functionality

This is the biggest challenge faced in this application since it invloves using webhooks and then an onboarding form which updates the user's details. It is tricky due to the flow of events ie, creation of the user in database and then updating that same user with new data.

#### 2. Discover Users functionality

A simple looking yet pretty tricky to implement feature of this app which was done through profile matching using ML Models of HuggingFace. It also invloves searching, and profile matching.

#### 3. Multiple File Upload

One of the features that makes this app stand out. It was quite difficult to implement this feature, given the no. of resources available to do so.

#### 4. Admin Dashboard

The app provides functionality to manage users on the app. This was made easy by Clerk's Documentation.

#### 5. Stories

An instagram story like feature that lets users post a story which is automatically deleted after 24 hours by a cron job. It was a tricky feature to implement.

#### 6. Realtime 1 on 1 and Group Chat

One of the most important feature of the app, that lets users interact with each other with a click of a button through any user's profile page. The app also provides for the users to form groups with their followers. The realtime functionality was achieved through pusher. This was also expanded upon to send special Jam request with the click of a button which lets any user sent a Jam request to others with an auto generated message.

#### 7. Role based access system

One of the advanced features for any web application. This was made very easy through Clerk and their documentation which would otherwise have required much more time and effort to achieve

## Further Improvements/Features

- Searching through posts.
- Being able to actually host events on the app (similar to unstop)
- Allowing users to post vidoes of their work. (which requires more storage than what most free tier offer, ie, 2GB for uploadthing)
- Users can search through their selected tags
- Connecting user's spotify account and fetching data from spotify api to build a better music profile and suggestion system

### Note

The initial page might take a few seconds to load. After the sign up page, you will be shown loading screen before onboarding which takes quite sometime since MongoDB database is not connected to the server and hence webhooks call can not be completed quickly. Consider reloading the welcome page (if it take more than ~15-20s) so that the "complete onboarding" button appears. I tried my best to lower the load time.
