## Challenges faced

Here are some of the challenges I faced:

#### 1. Onboarding functionality

This is the biggest challenge faced in this application since it invloves using webhooks and then an onboarding form which updates the user's details. It is tricky due to the flow of events ie, creation of the user in database and then updating that same user with new data.

#### 2. Discover Users functionality

A simple looking yet pretty tricky to implement feature of this app which was done through profile matching using ML Models of HuggingFace. It also invloves searching, and profile matching.

#### Multiple File Upload

A greate feature that makes this app stand out. It was quite difficult to implement this feature, given the no. of resources available to do so.

#### 4. Admin Dashboard

The app provides functionality to manage users on the app. This was made easy by Clerk's Documentation.

#### 5. Stories

An instagram story like feature that lets users post a story which is automatically deleted after 24 hours by a cron job. It was a tricky feature to implement.

#### 6. Realtime 1 on 1 and Group Chat

One of the most important feature of the app, that lets users interact with each other with a click of a button through any user's profile page. The app also provides for the users to form groups with their followers. The realtime functionality was achieved through pusher. This was also expanded upon to send special Jam request with the click of a button which lets any user sent a Jam request to others with an auto generated message.
